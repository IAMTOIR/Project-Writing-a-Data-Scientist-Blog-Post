To describe the findings, I wrote a medium-length blog entry.

## Introduction
This project is part of the Nanodegree Program for Data Scientists at Udacity.

## Business Understanding
Based on information obtained from data.opendevelopmentmekong.net I dug deep into analysis to get answers to three major questions:

1. State of Affairs 2020–2021 in Vietnam
2. State of Affairs 2020–2021 in ASEAN and China
3. Which country resulted in the fastest spread of COVID-19?
