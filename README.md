To describe the findings, I wrote a medium-length blog entry at https://medium.com/@thoai.phank18/covid-19-impact-assessment-in-asean-and-china-2020-2021-2ee9bdc6337e

## Introduction
This project is part of the Nanodegree Program for Data Scientists at Udacity.

## Business Understanding
Based on information obtained from data.opendevelopmentmekong.net I dug deep into analysis to get answers to three major questions:

1. What is the state of affairs in Vietnam in 2020-2021?
2. Current Situation in ASEAN and China in 2020-2021
3. Which nation had the most rapid spread of COVID-19?
