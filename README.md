1- Business Understanding

We investigated if North America was a better place for a software engineer to settle than Europe.

To do so, it is vital to understand job searchers' goals; factors such as compensation, possibility for wage growth, and job contentment are critical in identifying the optimal location.

We asked three questions for this: 
- Which location has the greatest salary?
- Which region has the biggest wage growth?
- Which area provides the most job satisfaction?

2- Data Understanding

The information is derived from the stack overflow 2017 survey [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
The Annual Developer Survey explores all areas of the developer experience, from learning to code to favored tools to version control and professional developers' job experiences.

3- Prepare Data

For the data preparation step, we obtained the data, reviewed it, and then cleaned it, focusing on our columns of interest using the Numpy and Pandas Python tools.

4- Data Modeling

Using the Python packages matplotlib and seaborn, we graphed several behaviors related to the three issues.

5- Evaluate the Results

We came to the following results based on the three questions: 
- Which location has the greatest salary? North America  
- Which region has the biggest wage growth? Both follow a similar trend 
â€“ Which area provides the most job satisfaction? They begin similarly in the first year of employment, but then Europe experiences a decline in satisfaction that does not fully recover until 20 years later.

A summary of the investigation's findings: In the end, we determined that North America is the best option.
